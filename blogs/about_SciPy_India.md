# SciPy India

## What is SciPy India?

SciPy India is a community-driven initiative that aims to promote the use of scientific computing and data science in India. It is part of the larger SciPy ecosystem, which includes various conferences, workshops, and online resources dedicated to the Python programming language and its applications in science and engineering, with a focus on the Indian context of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and open science, and its significance in the Indian research and development landscape.

## Mission

Our mission is to foster a collaborative environment where researchers, scientists, software engineers, and enthusiasts can come together to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and advance the field of scientific computing in India. We aim to provide resources, organize events, and create opportunities for learning and networking within the Indian scientific community.

Primarily, we focus on:
- Promoting the use of Python and its scientific libraries in research and development across India.
- Encouraging open-source contributions and collaborations among Indian researchers and developers.
- Organizing events, workshops, and conferences to facilitate knowledge sharing and skill development.
- Building a strong network of professionals and enthusiasts in the field of scientific computing in India.
- Advocating for open science practices and the use of FOSS in Indian academia and industry.
- and more!

## SciPy India over the years

SciPy India has been active since its inception, organizing various events and initiatives to support the scientific computing community in India. Some of our notable activities include:
- Hosting annual SciPy India conferences that bring together experts and enthusiasts from across the country.
- Conducting workshops and tutorials on various scientific computing topics, including data analysis, machine learning,
    and visualization.
- Collaborating with academic institutions and industry partners to promote the use of Python in research and development projects.
- Providing online resources, such as tutorials, documentation, and forums, to support the learning and development of scientific computing skills.
- Facilitating mentorship programs to help newcomers navigate the field of scientific computing and connect with experienced professionals.
- Engaging in outreach activities to raise awareness about the importance of scientific computing and open science in India.

The first edition of the SciPy India conference was held in 2009 at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. Since then, we have organized annual conferences in various cities across India, including Bangalore, Delhi, and Hyderabad. Each conference has featured keynote speakers, technical sessions, and networking opportunities for attendees.

Post 2020, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, SciPy India adapted to the new normal by transitioning to virtual events. This shift allowed us to reach a broader audience and continue our mission of promoting scientific computing in India despite the challenges posed by the pandemic.

SciPy India 2021 was the last edition of the conference held virtually, and since then, the community has been on a hiatus. However, come to 2025, we are thrilled to announce the revival of SciPy India with plans to host the next conference in 2025. We are currently in the planning stages, and we are excited to announce that we plan to resume in-person conferences in the near future, while also exploring hybrid formats to accommodate a wider audience.
